Powerswitch

Our switches finally arrived.  
I bought from CPC (http://www.cpc.co.uk) the PL11247, which is a 2A power switch.  
It requires no soldering and can be installed with the minimum of tools.

1. Open up the switch, screws on this one are underneath.  You will see the terminals inside, loosen them now.
2. Cut the lead from the PSU.  I left about 6 inches on the end.  You may wish to leave more or less depending on your individual setup.
3. Trim down the insulation on the outer cable to about 20mm and the insulation on the inner cables to leave about 5mm of copper wire exposed.
4. On this particular switch, I made the permanent connection the negative (black) wire and the positive (red) wire on the switch.  This is normal practice.
5. Tighten everything down once the wires are in place.
6. Test and enjoy the feeling that you won't be replacing Pi's because Year 4 have trashed the power sockets.
